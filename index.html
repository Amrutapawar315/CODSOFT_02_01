          MS Dhoni was born to Pan Singh and Devki Devi in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand), on July 7, 1981. 
          He is the only skipper in cricket history to have taken home every ICC trophy. He was selected 
          for the 1997/98 Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and did well there thanks to his outstanding 
          wicketkeeping, which made him the Commando Cricket Club's regular wicketkeeper (1995-1998).
          He held a position as a TTE for South Eastern Railway in Midnapore, West Bengal, from 2001 to 2003.
          He first represented Bihar and then the Jharkhand Cricket team in domestic cricket in India. 
          Three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a few half-centuries in other competitions were 
          among Dhoni's accomplishments during the 2002-03 season. He gained worldwide popularity for 
          his low-order contribution and hard-hitting batting style.

            Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Parachute Regiment of the Indian Territorial Army 
            (106 Para TA battalion). The honorary rank was presented to him by the Indian Army in 2011 for his 
            service to the nation as a cricketer. After completing five parachute training jumps from Indian Army 
            aircraft in the Agra training camp, he became a qualified paratrooper in 2015. In August 2019, he completed a 
            two-week stint with the Territorial Army in Jammu and Kashmir. While spending a day with the parachute regiment 
            in Ranchi, Dhoni said, I wanted to become a soldier not a cricketer, "Since childhood I wanted to join 
            the Army. Seeing the soldiers, I thought that one day I'll be the same".
